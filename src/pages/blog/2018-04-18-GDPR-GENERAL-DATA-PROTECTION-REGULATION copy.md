Businesses must request and receive agreement from the users to collect, use or move personal data, and for what purpose.
Further Businesses shall provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format.

**Right to be Forgotten** <br/>
The right to be forgotten entitles the data subject to have the data controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data.

**Data Protection Officers** <br/>
(DPOs) employees will be hired for their expert knowledge on data protection laws and practices if the processing is carried out by a public authority, except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity or if, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of the data subjects.
